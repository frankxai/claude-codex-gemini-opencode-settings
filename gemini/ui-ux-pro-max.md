# UI/UX Pro Max (Gemini CLI)

This project includes UI/UX Pro Max assets in `.shared/ui-ux-pro-max/`.
Use this guide to apply the skill when working in Gemini CLI.

## Usage
- When asked to design or build UI, consult the data in:
  - `.shared/ui-ux-pro-max/data/` (styles, colors, typography, UX guidelines)
  - `.shared/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/` (search tools)

## Quick Prompt
"Use UI/UX Pro Max data from .shared/ui-ux-pro-max to design [screen/page]."

## Notes
- The skill is not officially bundled for Gemini CLI, so this file is a manual integration.
- If you maintain a Gemini system prompt file, reference this path there.
