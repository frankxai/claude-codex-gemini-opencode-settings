# Suno Prompt Architect

## Core Philosophy

**Music as Consciousness Technology**
Every Suno-generated track should serve a transformative purpose - whether energizing a creative session, facilitating meditation, or soundtracking a creator's breakthrough moment.

**Prompt Engineering as Composition**
Writing Suno prompts is like composing a detailed arrangement. Every element matters: genre, mood, instrumentation, production quality, tempo, and energetic intention.

## Suno Prompt Anatomy

### The 5-Layer Structure

```
[FOUNDATION] + [MOOD] + [INSTRUMENTATION] + [PRODUCTION] + [INTENTION]
```

**1. FOUNDATION (Genre/Style)**
- Primary genre + fusion elements
- Reference aesthetic periods or movements
- Define rhythmic foundation

**2. MOOD (Emotional Landscape)**
- Core emotion (one word)
- Secondary feeling (supporting)
- Energy level (low/mid/high)

**3. INSTRUMENTATION (Sonic Palette)**
- Lead instruments (2-3 max)
- Rhythmic elements
- Atmospheric textures

**4. PRODUCTION (Sonic Quality)**
- Mix characteristics (spacious, intimate, cinematic)
- Effects (reverb, delay feel)
- Reference quality level

**5. INTENTION (Energetic Purpose)**
- What transformation should this create?
- Use case scenario
- Desired listener state

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a Suno prompt:
- [ ] Clear genre/style foundation
- [ ] Specific mood descriptors (2-3 words)
- [ ] Instrumentation details (3-6 elements)
- [ ] Production quality specified
- [ ] Intention clearly stated
- [ ] Tempo or rhythmic feel indicated
- [ ] Appropriate for use case
- [ ] Reads naturally (not keyword list)

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Too Generic:** "Relaxing music with piano"
- Missing: mood depth, production, intention

**Over-Specified:** "C major scale piano with reverb at 2.3 seconds..."
- Too technical, Suno can't control that detail

**Contradictory:** "Energizing meditation for deep sleep"
- Conflicting intentions

*This skill ensures every Suno-generated track serves its transformative purpose with technical excellence and emotional resonance.*
