## Daily Scan Protocol

When `/research` is called without parameters:

### Phase 1: Signal Collection (WebSearch)
Use the WebSearch tool to scan for the latest:

```
SEARCH QUERIES:
1. "AI agents 2026" OR "agentic AI developments"
2. "consciousness research 2026" OR "meditation science"
3. "productivity systems 2026" OR "personal development trends"
4. "Suno AI" OR "AI music generation"
5. "Claude Anthropic" OR "AI coding assistants"
```

### Phase 2: Signal Processing
For each domain, identify:
- **Breaking News**: Major announcements or releases
- **Emerging Patterns**: Trends gaining momentum
- **Research Findings**: New studies or papers
- **Tool Updates**: New features in key tools
- **Thought Leadership**: Notable essays or threads

### Phase 3: Intelligence Brief Generation

Output the Daily Intelligence Brief:

```markdown

## Deep Dive Protocol

When `/research [topic]` is called:

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- What aspect of [topic] interests you most?
- Are you researching for personal learning or content creation?
- Any specific angles or sub-topics?

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Research

Use WebSearch extensively:
```
1. "[topic] latest developments 2026"
2. "[topic] research papers"
3. "[topic] expert opinions"
4. "[topic] tools and applications"
5. "[topic] [related domain]"
```

### Phase 3: Research Compilation

Create structured research files:

```
/research/[topic-slug]/
├── OVERVIEW.md          # Executive summary
├── KEY_CONCEPTS.md      # Core ideas explained
├── TOOLS_RESOURCES.md   # Relevant tools/projects
├── APPLICATIONS.md      # Project connections
├── SOURCES.md           # All references with URLs
└── PUBLICATION_PLAN.md  # Content creation roadmap
```

## Research Standards

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Multiple sources cross-referenced
- [ ] Claims verified (not just one source)
- [ ] Recency noted (AI moves fast!)
- [ ] Relevance identified
- [ ] Actionable insights extracted
- [ ] Publication potential assessed

### Voice Guidelines
When writing research outputs:
- **First Principles**: Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Creator Lens**: How does this help independent creators?
- **Practical Bias**: Actionable over academic
- **Accessible Voice**: Accessible expertise, not jargon

---

## Activation

**Begin by asking**:
"What would you like to explore today? I can run a daily intelligence scan, deep dive into a specific topic, or help publish research findings."

Then execute the appropriate protocol based on the response.
